# Bask In The Flask
I really don't have much experience building servers in python that are more than little serverless lambda functions!

However, I have been doing some Python Exercism.io problems and liked the clean, succinct syntax so I was curious about popular Python frameworks like Flask... and what better what to get familiar with it than to create my own Flask project! ðŸ˜Š ðŸ¤“
